# Dining-philosophores

## Problem Statement:
Consider there are five philosophers sitting around a circular dining table with five bowls of spaghetti. A chopstick is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

## Rules:
- A Philosopher can only eat when he has both left and right chopsticks
- Each chopstick can be held only by one philosopher 
- After eating, he needs to put down both the chopsticks so they become available to others
- A philosopher can grab the chopstick on left or right as they become available and he canâ€™t start eating until he has both the chopsticks

## Output:
